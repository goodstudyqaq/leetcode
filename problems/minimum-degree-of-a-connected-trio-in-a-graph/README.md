The essence of the problem is to find the smallest degree three-cycle (triangle) in a graph, and the challenge is to enumerate the possibilities with the most efficient complexity. The most straightforward approach would be to use three nested for-loops. However, this method involves a significant amount of redundant enumeration, as we are only interested in finding the vertex with the minimum degree. Instead, we can sort the vertices based on their degrees, and during the first level of enumeration, we can iterate over all edges (u, v). In the second level of enumeration, we only need to find the first vertex w in the order of degrees that satisfies the conditions of having edges (u, w) and (v, w), at which point we can directly break the loop.

As for the complexity, it is a bit tricky to calculate. Let's consider the worst-case scenario where both levels of the for-loops are fully iterated. This can be transformed into another problem: in a graph with no triangles, what is the maximum number of edges it can have? Here, we can apply Mantel's theorem:

Mantel's theorem: If a graph G on n vertices contains no triangles, then it contains at most n^2/4 edges.

Proof link: Mantel's Theorem Proof

Thus, the maximum number of edges will be n^2/4, and the complexity of the algorithm will be O(n^3/4).
